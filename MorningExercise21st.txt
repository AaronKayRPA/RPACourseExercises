1. Write functions for a full burger meal: (I dont think this code is correct but hopefully the concept is correct)

def makeburger():
		burger = "bottom patty" + "hamburger" + "tomato" + "lettuce" + "pickles" + "sauce" + "top patty"
		burgeramount = 1

def makeside():
		side = "salt" + "chips"
		sideamount = 1

def makedrink():
		drinkflavour = input("What flavour drink would you like?\n")
		size = input("What size " + drinkflavour + " would you like?\n")
		drink = (size + drinkflavour)
		drinkamount = 1

def makefullmeal():
	
	makeburger()
	makeside()
	makedrink()

	if ((burgeramount >= 1) and (sideamount >= 1) and (drinkamount >= 1)):
		print("Here is your meal")
		burgeramount -= 1
		sideamount -= 1
		drinkamount -= 1

makefullmeal()

2. Create a program/recipe for a fruit salad, using examples of all 3 operator groups:

def maketastysalad():
	orangesamount = 4
	applesamount = 8
	pearsamount = 2

	while (applesamount > orangesamount) and (orangesamount > pearsamount):
		orangesamount += 1
		pearsamount += 1
		
		if (applesamount) == (orangesamount):
			continue
	print("We made a tasty salad with ", orangesamount, " oranges, ", applesamount, " apples and ", pearsamount, "pears")

maketastysalad()
